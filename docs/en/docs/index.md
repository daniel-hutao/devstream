## What Does DevStream Do

- Kickoff DevOps in 5 minutes: tired of investigating and integrating all the DevOps tools? Get your open-source, customized DevOps toolchain up and running with one command.
- Build your DevOps toolchain like Lego: boost team productivity by plugging in, replacing, or upgrading the tool of your choice with minimal operational overhead. Unleash the full potential of your toolchain with best practices.
- Embrace new opportunities: say goodbye to vendor lock-in. Never let your toolchain become your bottleneck. Feel the pulse of new DevOps tools, methodologies, and practices.

## Why Use DevStream

- Too much effort maintaining every piece of DevOps tool?
- Too challenging (if not impossible) to track who changed what?
- Too much hassle replacing some of your DevOps tools that you would choose "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"?
- Small team, many tools, and way too few DevOps engineers to fully implement your pipelines?

Worry no more. DevStream got you covered.

## Under the Hood

- DevOps toolchain as code: centrally manage your toolchain with version-controlled code, and keep track of everything.
- Core-Plugin architecture: no reinventing the wheel. Reuse or even create a plugin, and connect any tools you like with DevStream.
- Best practice templates: choose our recommended best-practice toolchain template that suits your needs. Implement built-in best practices and share yours with the world.
